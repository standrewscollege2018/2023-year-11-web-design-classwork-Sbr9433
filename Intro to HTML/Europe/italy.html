        <h1>Italy</h1>
        <p>We struck Italy in the middle of a heatwave, yet still loved exploring the famous sights.</p>
        <h2>Venice</h2>

        <p>Venice, while crowded with tourists and a little smelly in places, is still an amazing place to visit.</p>
        <p>You need to get yourself lost in all the narrow streets and canals, and enjoy the hospitality of those few locals still left living on the island.</p>
        <h2>Amalfi</h2>
