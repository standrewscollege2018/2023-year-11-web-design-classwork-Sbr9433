        <p>Sefton was born with a brain cell defficiency. But due to the incredible nature of all children named Sefton, he overcame this and grew to be the wonderfull child we know today.</p>
        <h2>Age 0-3</h2>
        <p>Sefton did nothing for these years. He was diagnosed with a severe form of blindness and needed glasses</p>
        <h2>Age 4-5</h2>
        <p>Finally, Sefton showed some real change. His parents were worried he would never develop any social skills, but luckily he did.</p>
        <p>Sefton finally said his first words (I need to go bathroom) and everybody rejoiced.</p>
        <h2>4+</h2>
        <p>Sefton went back to not advancing. He can still only say "I need to go bathroom". But we love him anyway</p>
